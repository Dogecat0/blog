## **üîé Intro**
In this post, I will start creating resources in Azure using Pulumi. The full process is quite complex, so I will try to break it down into smaller parts and raise the key points here during my implementation.

## **üìÅ Resource Group**

The resources in Azure are organized into resource groups. A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. You can deploy, update, and delete multiple resources in a resource group together. More about [Azure Resource Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).

Probably more to be added while it's going but at this moment the key resources I am using are:
- Container App
- Container Registry
- SQL Server    
- SQL Database
- Key Vault
- Storage Account
- Blob Container
- DevOps
- Network
- Insights

I've organized my resources into three resource groups:
## 1. 'web_app_rg':
- Container App
- Container Registry
- SQL Server
- SQL Database
- Key Vault
- Storage Account
- Blob Container

**The pros of organizing resources into a resource group are:**
- This group has all application-realted resources, making it easier to manage and monitor the web application.
- It's easier to mange updates, scaling, and eployments since all app components are in one place.
- Simplifies tracking and optimizing costs specifically associated with the web application itself.
- It grants the easier managing permissions for developers and operators who need access only to the application resources.

## 2. 'devops_rg':
- DevOps

**The pros of organizing resources into a resource group are:**
- It keeps DevOps resources reparate from the actual application resources, reducing the risk of accidental interference.
- It enhanced security by isolating DevOps tools and credentials, ensuring taht only DevOps access.
- It simplifies scaling DevOps tools independently of the application resources.

## 3. 'network_and_monitoring_rg':
- Network
- Insights

**The pros of organizing resources into a resource group are:**
- Network resources like VNETS, subnets, and security groups are in one place, making it easier to manage network configurations and security.
- It centralized location for all monitoring tools, which simplifies the process of setting up and managing alerts, dashboards, and logs.
- It enhanced security byisolating network and monitoring resources, ensuring network configurations are not tampered with unintentially.

Organizing resources into resource groups is a good practice for managing and monitoring resources in Azure. It depends on the complexity of the application and the team's requirements bae on the resources' nature and purpose. Resources in different resource groups can communicate with each other, which makes it possible if you need more resource groups in the future.

## **üì¶ Container Registry**

Azure Container Registry is a managed, private Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. It allows you to store and manage container images for all types of container deployments. More about [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/).

The Pulumi code to create a container registry in Azure can be find [here](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/azure-native/api-docs/containerregistry/registry/)

**Things to consider when creating a container registry:**
- Assign role-based access control (RBAC) roles to the registry to control access to the registry like `AcrPull` and `AcrPush`.
(‚ö†Ô∏è Note here, when assigning the roles using `pulumi_azure_native.authorization.RoleAssignment` to groups or uses in Pulumi Azure, there is one thing quite confusing:
`roleDefinitionId`: This is the Identifier of the role definition to assign to the principal, which uses the ID of the roles in Azure as part of it.
example of the Identifier: `"/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"` and `providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`is the ID of the role in Azure you are going to assign.
Currently in Pulumi latest azure-native module, it does not support retrieving the role ID from the role name, so you need to define a function using Azure CLI and use it in the Pulumi code. For example:
```python
def get_role_id_by_name(role_name):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            [
                "az",
                "role definition",
                "list",
                "--query",
                f"[?roleName=='{role_name}'].id",
                "--output",
                "json",
            ],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True,
        )
        roles = json.loads(result.stdout)
        if roles:
            return roles[0]
        return None
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error running az command: {e}")
        return None
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding JSON: {e}")
        return None
```
)
- SKU: Choose the SKU based on the requirements of the application. The SKU determines the capabilities and features of the registry. Here it has `Basic` and `Standard` SKUs.
- Registry Name: The name of the registry must be unique within Azure. It must be between 5 and 50 characters long alphanumeric.
(‚ö†Ô∏è Note here, since the registry name must be unique within Azure, so it's a good idea to include a unique name like your organization name or project name in it. (e.g., `<your-project-name>containerregistry`). This also applies to other resources in Azure. It's also a good practice if you can add corresponding environment names to the resources to make it easier to identify which resources belong to which environment.)
- Export the registry name and login server to use in the container app deployment.
