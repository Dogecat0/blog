## **‚ö†Ô∏èBenchmarking:**

The benchmark values used in the calculations are hypothetical and should be adjusted based on industry standards, historical performance, and peer comparisons. It is essential to consider the context and relevance of the metrics when determining the benchmark values for normalization.

## Methods for Obtaning Benchmark Values

**Industry Averages:**
- Use financial databases like Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, or Reuters to obtain industry averages for each metric. These databases aggregate financial data from a wide range of companies in the same industry.

**Peer Comparison**:
- Identify a set of peer companies within the same industry and similar market capitalization. calculate the average values of these metrics for tese peer companies.
- Tools: use platforms like Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, or GuruFocus to find peer groups and their financial data.

**Historical Performance:**
- Use the company's historical data to establish benchmarks. This method is useful for metrics where historical performance is a good indicator of expected performance.
- Tools: Company annual reports, financial statement archives, and SEC filings (EDGAR database)

**Analyst Estimates:**
- Analyst reports from investment banks or financial services firms often contain benchmark data and industry norms. These reports can provide a professional perspective on what constitutes good performance in a given industry.
- Tools: Reports from Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, etc.

**Economic and Industry Reports:**
- Reports from industry groups, trade associations, and economic research firms can provide benchmark data. These sources often conduct surveys and research to eastablish industry standards.

**Custom Benchmark Creation:**
- Create custom benchmarks by using a weighted average of the metrics from the top-perfoming companies in the industry.
- Tools: Excel or specialized financial analysis software like FactSet or Capital IQ.
