It's been a while since last time I update the Inomad series. The current demo on GitHub for [Inomad](https://github.com/Dogecat0/inomad-demo) is here, but maybe slightly out of date as I've been constantly updating Inomad. The product lines and the product model have been the main updates recently. The categories, the materials, the colors, the sizes, the main product and variants, all these core attributes of the product model are fun to work with. Also another important part of Inomad product is the sustainable mateiral and recylcing idea. Hopefully I can share more about them soon and put website into production.
