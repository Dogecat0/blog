## Intro

In this post, I will be covering React and related concepts like Vite, Components, JSX, etc which comprise the part1-a of the course.

## New concept:

- React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently. [More details](https://react.dev/)
- Vite: Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for web projects. It uses native ES modules for serving code instead of bundling during development, which results in significantly faster start times. It supports frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, and more. [Mode details](https://vitejs.dev/)
- React components: Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces. [More details](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)
- JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. [More details](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)<br />
Main rules of JSX:
    - Return a single root element
    - Use camelCase for HTML attributes
    - Close all tags
<br />
