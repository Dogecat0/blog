## **üîé Intro**

In this post, I'll summarize the key points from my second month of investing in stocks with GPT. So far, it's not a fully integrated process as I'm still meandering through the learning curve of how to invest with GPT, so the series will just focus on the key figures and decisions for the moment. There were also many interesting events that had an impact on the stock market worth addressing, but again, those will be included in future series as the learning progresses.
