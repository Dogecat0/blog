When committing changes, split them into logical groups of files and changes. Create separate commits for different aspects like domain changes, infrastructure updates, tests, configuration, etc. This makes the change history clearer and easier to review.

**IMPORTANT**: When writing commit messages, exclude Claude watermark like 'Co-Authored-By' or any other internal identifiers from the commit messages.
