## **ðŸ”Ž Intro**

From this post onwards, I will start exploring the related knowledge of infrastructure for software applications, particularly in the cloud. This post will cover the basics of cloud computing.

Cloud computing is a technology paradigm that allows users to access and store data and applications on remote servers over the internet rather than on local servers or personal computers. This model offers flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency. Here are the core foundations of cloud computing:

## **1. **On-Demand Self-Service****
- Definition: Users can provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
- Key Features: Web-based interfaces, automation tools, API access.

## **2. **Broad Network Access****
- Definition: Cloud services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
- Key Features: Accessibility from any device, anywhere.

## **3. **Resource Pooling****
- Definition: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.
- Key Features: Location independence, resource sharing, virtualization.

## **4. **Rapid Elasticity****
- Definition: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
- Key Features: Scalability, flexibility, auto-scaling.

## **5. **Measured Service****
- Definition: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
- Key Features: Pay-per-use, metered service, resource monitoring, billing.
