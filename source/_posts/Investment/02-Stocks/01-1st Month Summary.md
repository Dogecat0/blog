## **üîé Intro**

In this post, I'll summarize the key points from my first month of investing in stocks with GPT. It's been an interesting journey so far trying out investing with GPT as a new investing learner.

First, I'm an aboslutely greenhorn in investment. With the power of GPT, I think it would be fun and educational to do an experienment investing with it, learning with it. I'll only share some key findings in this post, the stocks I've invested in, and the overall performance of my portfolio. Regarding the detailed usage of GPT and the analysis of each company, I'll cover them in separate posts in the future while I keep learning.

## **üìà Portfolio Performance**

I started investing in individual stocks from 14th of May this year on a quite popular platform Trading212 which is an easy-to-use, 0 commision fee platform. For now there is no need to compare different platforms, let's go back to the main point. During the first month I have invested in the following companies so far with the percentage of the total portfolio:

- Microsoft (MSFT): 19.91%
- Nvidia (NVDA): 18.77%
- Amazon (AMZN): 13.62%
- Barclays (BARC): 10.53%
- Alphabet Class A (GOOGL): 8.34%
- CrowdStrike (CRWD): 7.49%
- Mastercard (MA): 6.61%
- Costco Wholesale (COST): 6.29%
- Broadcom (AVGO): 6.05%
- Vistra Corp (VST): 2.39%

So far, the total return of the portfolio is 6.05%, meanwhile the S&P 500 index has returned 2.33% in the same period. At the time when I was typing, another ETF hit me and I had a quick look which is Invesco QQQ, with the return at 5.80% (With the currently limited knowledge I think it's a good index to follow together with S&P 500). The portfolio has outperformed them 3.72% and 0.25% respectively in the first month.

The gain and loss of each stock in the portfolio are as follows:

- Microsoft (MSFT): +5.68%
- Nvidia (NVDA): +23.01%
- Amazon (AMZN): +0.05%
- Barclays (BARC): -6.94%
- Alphabet Class A (GOOGL): +2.44%
- CrowdStrike (CRWD): +8.88%
- Mastercard (MA): -1.41%
- Costco Wholesale (COST): +3.10%
- Broadcom (AVGO): +24.94%
- Vistra Corp (VST): -11.80%

## **üõí Buying Strategy**

As a salaried average person, I've decided to go with the most reliable method:a long-term investment strategy. I've invested in companies that I believe have strong fundamentals and growth potential in the future (Of course AI AI and AI for most of them). So the buying strategy is quite simple: buy and hold with bi-weekly top up.

## **üìä End of Period Adjustments**

For now I will hold all the companies I've invested in. Based on my current ability, I've adjusted the percentage of each company in the portfolio to keep the portfolio balanced. Of course with the learning journey continues, I will continue to monitor the performance of each company and make adjustments if necessary.

- Microsoft (MSFT): 17%
- Nvidia (NVDA): 14%
- Amazon (AMZN): 12%
- Alphabet Class A (GOOGL): 12%
- CrowdStrike (CRWD): 11%
- Broadcom (AVGO): 11%
- Costco Wholesale (COST): 10%
- Mastercard (MA): 7%
- Barclays (BARC): 5%
- Vistra Corp (VST): 1%

## **üìù Next Steps**

Learn, learn and learn. I think there are couple of things I need to learn more about:

- How to pick up the right companies to invest in
- How to analyze the financial status of a company
- How to manage and monitor the portfolio to help make adjustments if necessary
- To help achive the above all, learn how to use GPT to help me with the analysis and make better decisions
